Implements a Neural Network using NumPy:
1. Parameters like epoch and learning rate are given at the top of the .py file as global variables.
2. Trial features and labels (representing cat/dog/mouse images) are generated using NumPy random methods.

Network Capabilities:
1. Has a hidden layer with 4 nodes, output layer with 3 nodes.
2. Model consists of 20 weights, 7 biases, initialized randomly
